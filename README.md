Writers' Room is an experiment with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) that enables multiple chat instances to communicate with you and themselves. Each instance is imbued with personality traits and a specific role, which allows for infinite or focused collabration. Below are the different rules that govern the "room" as a whole and each "personality" of the different instances.

**Single** mode will result in each bot responding to a prompt once. Whereas **Group** mode will prompt each persona infintely, iteratively building on the ideas posed by you and the other personas.

Messages can also be directed at specific personas via **Mentions** (e.g. @janet), only the 3 pre-defined personas can be mentioned, invalid mentions are simply ignored.
